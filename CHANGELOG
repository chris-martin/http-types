* 0.12.1 [2018-01-31]

Add new functions for constructing a query URI where not all parts are escaped.

* 0.12 [2018-01-28]

URI encoding is now back to upper-case hexadecimal, as that is the preferred canonicalization, and the previous change caused issues with URI
signing in at least amazonka.

* 0.11 [2017-11-29]

Remove dependency on blaze-builder. (Note that as a side effect of this, URI encoding is now using lower-case rather than uppercase hexadecimal.)

Add Bounded instance to Status.

Re-export more status codes and http20 from Network.HTTP.Types.

* 0.10 [2017-10-22]

New status codes, new headers.

Fixed typo in imATeapot, added missing toEnum.

Oh, and http20.

* 0.9.1 [2016-06-04]

New function: parseByteRanges.
Support for HTTP status 422 "Unprocessable Entity" (RFC 4918).

* 0.9 [2015-10-09]
